Database structure for  branch:

Table geopoly    //master table for polygons:
Fields:
polynum:   integer  (3 byte) autoincrement primary key
country:   char(2)  //2 character country code- same as used for internet domains
name: varchar(30)  //identifying name of the airspace.  Not used by the application but useful to keep track
base:  integer  unsigned (2 byte) //base of airspace in feet (assumes equivalence of feet and flight level)
outline: linestring   // must be closed; spatial index on this field

Table geocircle:
Fields:
circlenum:  integer  (3 byte) autoincrement primary key
country:   char(2)  //2 character country code- same as used for internet domains
name: varchar(30)  //identifying name of the airspace.  Not used by the application but useful to keep track
base:  integer  unsigned (2 byte) //base of airspace in feet (assumes equivalence of feet and flight level)
