# How to Contribute

*Flightview* exists for the benefit of the whole gliding 
community. With your help, it can be made more powerful, more 
reliable, more elegant and hopefully more *useful* in the future.

Note this is a work in progress- intended to be a port of IGCWebView (repository at 
[https://github.com/GlidingWeb/IGCWebView](https://github.com/GlidingWeb/IGCWebView), production version at [http://glidingweb.org/igcWebview](http://glidingweb.org/igcWebview). Therefore any suggestions for feature enhancement or other constructive criticism are best e-mailed to igcwebview@glidingweb.org.

Suggestions from programmers concerning either application are welcome.

Thanks in advance for your contributions!
